# BruinMatch

## What is BruinMatch
Any college student can tell you the process of finding roommates is tedious. Students not only are expected to reach out and find potential candidates but also match their potential roommatesâ€™ ideal living situations with their own. There have been many attempts at perfecting this art from Facebook groups to random outreach. 

Our solution to the disorganized way that roommate searching is conducted is called BruinMatch. BruinMatch is a centralized online platform where users can filter through other BruinMatch members, based on preferred living styles to find their best fit.

## Relevant Features
1. Users can create a profile, login, and have data associated with them.
2. Users can see the most compatible member for them on the dynamic main page. 
3. Users can save/unsave the profile of a potential roommate candidate and notate why they saved the profile
4. Users can view saved profiles on a separate page
5. Users can view additional information about other users via a popup
6. Users can use the filtration feature to find roommates that match specific aspects of their lifestyle 
7. Users can edit and save changes to their profile even after account creation (such as profile picture, lifestyle preferences etc.)
8. Users can learn new trivia facts in main page via API call
